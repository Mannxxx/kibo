# KIBO: Smart Way to Grow Plants

KIBO is a project we developed during a hackathon organized by IIIT Kalyani. 
- We completed this project within 36 hours.
- It's an innovative application designed to encourage tree planting, where users are rewarded for planting trees.
- Additionally, users can track the progress of their trees by updating their growth status every week and capturing photos.
